// //pseudo code~
// A random number is generated by the computer between 19 and 120 which will be displayed to the player
// There are 4 "elements" each having a random hidden value between 1 and 12
// When the player clicks on a stone it will add a specific number of points to the player's total score

// if (the player's score === the computer's random number){
// 	the player wins, add to their wins counter
// } else if (the player's score > the computer's random number){
// 	the player loses, add to their losses counter
// }

// at the end of each win/loss condition reset the computer's number, the player's score and the values of the crystal
